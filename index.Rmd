# Preface {-}
Due to the nature of the Sentinel Asia (SA) works which are related to disaster response, Value Added Products (VAPs) are expected to be produced as soon as the data are available. The book serves as a guidance for streamlining the process and techniques for data processing related to SA Activities. Hence, it is expected that the book will help in reaching the objective.
