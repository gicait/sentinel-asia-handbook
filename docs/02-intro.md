# Introduction {#intro}

Sentinel Asia is a voluntary initiative to provide satellite data at a time of a disaster, and to coordinate support in collaboration with data provider nodes (DPNs), data analysis nodes (DANs), and disaster management organizations (DMOs) in the Asia-Pacific region. Data analyses and value added product (VAP) generation is done through several agencies including the GIC/AIT, which is the Primary Data Analysis Node (P-DAN). Moreover, Sentinel Asia also supports activities on disaster risk reduction (DRR) to its member countries in the region. In this respect, technical and disaster management organizations are members of Sentinel Asia and are known as joint project team members (JPTM).

The time lapse of work-flow from a disaster occurrence to the product delivery stage is an important factor that has a high impact on DRR activities. The work-flow is a process chain consisting of various stages such as an emergency observation request (EOR), Sentinel Asia activation, satellite observations, image processing and analyses, value-added product (VAPs) generation, product delivery and sharing. It is important to reduce the time gaps in this process chain. The GIC/AIT has provided the service as the P-DAN during the contract period.  

The main components of the works are (1) the Project Manager (PM) activities of the International Disaster Charter (IDC) and (2) generation, provision and evaluation of Value Added Products (VAPs).

All the service for Sentinel Asia activation is provided by effectively communicating with the Sentinel Asia Secretariat and collecting related information in order to identify the severity and to monitor the progress after an activation. Assistance is provided to the authorized users (AU) of the Asian Disaster Reduction Center (ADRC) member countries to receive data and products in a timely manner and to share VAPs with the ADRC and its member countries. After the VAPs are generated, close communication is maintained during the contract period with DAN members of the Sentinel Asia-activated countries. 


##	Project Manager (PM) Activities of International Disaster Charter (IDC)

When a major disaster occurs, the Asian Disaster Reduction Center (ADRC) can escalate a Sentinel Asia emergency observation request to the International Disaster Charter (IDC). A project manager (PM), such as the GIC/AIT, will be nominated from relevant national agencies or international organizations. The PM role is to ensure effective communication between the data providers or partner agencies (PA), value added companies/resellers and authorized users (AU). The PM will coordinate the activation, ensuring that the acquisition of satellite images is under way, managing the generation of products or information, and making sure that the products are delivered to the users according to their needs and expectations. The Charter activation is considered closed 30 days after the initial activation date or when the end users have enough products for their requirements. The PM will then have to submit a report to the Charter Executive Secretariat (the member of the PA that nominated the PM – in this case the JAXA) - within 45 days of the initial activation date through email or the COS-2 system. The PM report will conclude the PM’s work for this Charter activation.

## Sentinel Asia Activities
As the primary data analysis node (P-DAN) of Sentinel Asia, the GIC/AIT has been effectively communicating with the Sentinel Asia Secretariat/ADRC and coordinating the response of DAN members for each emergency observation request. The GIC/AIT analyzed satellite data which provided by the data provider nodes (DPNs), and then created VAPs and shared such satellite-based disaster information products to end users in timely manner. 







<!-- You can label chapter and section titles using `{#label}` after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter \@ref(intro). If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter \@ref(methods). -->

<!-- Figures and tables with captions will be placed in `figure` and `table` environments, respectively. -->

<!-- ```{r nice-fig, fig.cap='Here is a nice figure!', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'} -->
<!-- par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) -->
<!-- plot(pressure, type = 'b', pch = 19) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the `fig:` prefix, e.g., see Figure \@ref(fig:nice-fig). Similarly, you can reference tables generated from `knitr::kable()`, e.g., see Table \@ref(tab:nice-tab). -->

<!-- ```{r nice-tab, tidy=FALSE} -->
<!-- knitr::kable( -->
<!--   head(iris, 20), caption = 'Here is a nice table!', -->
<!--   booktabs = TRUE -->
<!-- ) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015]. -->
